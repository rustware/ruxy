/// as to get some useful metadata, like the Rust-provided type name of the contained error,
/// or the identifier of the route where this error originated from.

  /// Otherwise returns `None`.

  /// see the mutated value â€“ no clones are made.
  fn get_error_mut<T: 'static>(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T>;

  /// Returns the contained error of type `T` if the error matches that type.
  /// Otherwise returns `None`.

  /// description of the type. For example, amongst the strings that `type_name::<Option<String>>()` might return
  /// are `"Option<String>"` and `"std::option::Option<std::string::String>"`.
  ///
  /// The returned string must not be considered to be a unique identifier of a type as multiple types may map
  /// to the same type name. Similarly, there is no guarantee that all parts of a type will appear in the returned
  /// string: for example, lifetime specifiers are currently not included. In addition, the output may change
  /// between versions of the Rust compiler.

  /// not guaranteed.
