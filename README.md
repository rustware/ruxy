  <h1>Rust speed. React simplicity. Ruxy.</h1>

## Server-side rendering, reimagined.

Ruxy is an emerging web framework that brings together the performance of Rust and the flexibility of React.

It enables true server-side rendering without Node.js, V8, or JavaScript runtimes on the server — giving you
a fully native, type-safe backend that serves pre-hydrated React apps at incredible speed.

With Ruxy, you write your frontend in React, your backend in Rust, and deploy a single,
unified application — no compromise, no JS bloat, no V8.
